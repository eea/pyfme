-	 Use of biofuels: this impact cannot be estimated at the moment, due to the lack of studies and methodologies that establish emission factors for each of the aspects that are taken into account in the emission estimates: type of fuel, % mixture, vehicle type and category, technology, consumption of each type of fuel in each, driving pattern, speed, ambient temperature, etc. However, despite the lack of clear and conclusive evidence, the consulted bibliography1, 2, 3 could indicate possible reductions in emissions of some pollutants and increases in others, when compared with its fossil option. Reductions in particles, NOx and CO could be expected in the case of bioethanol, and decreases in particles, CO and hydrocarbons in the case of biodiesel. On the other hand, there could be increases in volatile organic compounds and NOx in bioethanol and biodiesel respectively. However, there are discrepancies in the magnitude and sign of the impact between the studies consulted and there is no complete and conclusive information available to estimate the impact in the future.
-	Biomass: the expected increase of consumption of solid biomass in the residential sector could lead to an impact on air quality due to the increase in particles in urban and rural environments. There is wide evidence of the relationship between biomass burning and air pollution, with global, regional and local impacts on air quality, health and climate4. Biomass combustion is widespread, is increasing and makes a significant contribution to PM2.5 ambient air levels, especially in winter, in the developed world, due to its use in domestic heating. The burning of biomass in agriculture is also a source of PM2.5 emissions and other pollutants5 and has been linked to health effects6. In Spain, the municipality of Villanueva del Arzobispo frequently registers high levels of particles in the coldest months of the year, exceeding the permitted levels in several years. Source contribution studies indicate that the high levels of particles originate from biomass combustion activities in domestic heating installations, among others7. The Villanueva del Arzobispo8 air quality plan seeks to return air quality to levels established by law. One of the measures established is the prohibition of burning biomass and other solid fuels in equipment that does not guarantee emissions below the limits established for fireplaces, stoves and boilers in Regulations (EU) 2015/1185 and 2015/1189 (eco-design regulation). For those types of facilities not included in the scope of these regulations, particle emissions may not exceed 50 mg/m³, referred to an O2 content of 13%. The air quality plan considers this measure as the one with the greatest impact on the reduction of particle emissions in the domestic sector. From the previous measure it is evident that the eco-design regulations do not cover the entire spectrum of domestic heating devices that could be used with solid biomass. Therefore, despite the efforts planned by Spain to promote the use of types of biomass less polluting and devices that comply with the limits established in the eco-design regulations, there is a lack of harmonized European regulations to cover the two main gaps:
•	Combustion boilers that use solid fuel (including woody biomass) with a nominal thermal power between 500 Kw and 1 MW.
•	Boilers and heaters/stoves that use non-woody biomass as solid fuel (of any nominal thermal power) excluded from both Regulation 2015/1189 and Regulation 2015/1185.
On the other hand, the estimates of the impacts of the consumption of renewable energies carried out by the European Environment Agency9, show how the emissions of particles derived from the use of biomass are not offset by the emissions avoided by the rest of renewables. Only in the year 2021, the increasing effect of the use of heat pumps for heating and cooling, produces a reversal of this fact, becoming renewables as a w",NA,"A qualitative impact estimate has been carried out based on a bibliographic review of data, evaluations, reports, studies and other documents, which have been referenced in the ""Estimated impact"" column and are listed below in order of appearance in the text:

405,Air quality,Use,"Use of bioliquids: no information available.
-	 Use of biofuels: this impact cannot be estimated at the moment, due to the lack of studies and methodologies that establish emission factors for each of the aspects that are taken into account in the emission estimates: type of fuel, % mixture, vehicle type and category, technology, consumption of each type of fuel in each, driving pattern, speed, ambient temperature, etc. However, despite the lack of clear and conclusive evidence, the consulted bibliography1, 2, 3 could indicate possible reductions in emissions of some pollutants and increases in others, when compared with its fossil option. Reductions in particles, NOx and CO could be expected in the case of bioethanol, and decreases in particles, CO and hydrocarbons in the case of biodiesel. On the other hand, there could be increases in volatile organic compounds and NOx in bioethanol and biodiesel respectively. However, there are discrepancies in the magnitude and sign of the impact between the studies consulted and there is no complete and conclusive information available to estimate the impact in the future.
-	Biomass: the expected increase of consumption of solid biomass in the residential sector could lead to an impact on air quality due to the increase in particles in urban and rural environments. There is wide evidence of the relationship between biomass burning and air pollution, with global, regional and local impacts on air quality, health and climate4. Biomass combustion is widespread, is increasing and makes a significant contribution to PM2.5 ambient air levels, especially in winter, in the developed world, due to its use in domestic heating. The burning of biomass in agriculture is also a source of PM2.5 emissions and other pollutants5 and has been linked to health effects6. In Spain, the municipality of Villanueva del Arzobispo frequently registers high levels of particles in the coldest months of the year, exceeding the permitted levels in several years. Source contribution studies indicate that the high levels of particles originate from biomass combustion activities in domestic heating installations, among others7. The Villanueva del Arzobispo8 air quality plan seeks to return air quality to levels established by law. One of the measures established is the prohibition of burning biomass and other solid fuels in equipment that does not guarantee emissions below the limits established for fireplaces, stoves and boilers in Regulations (EU) 2015/1185 and 2015/1189 (eco-design regulation). For those types of facilities not included in the scope of these regulations, particle emissions may not exceed 50 mg/m³, referred to an O2 content of 13%. The air quality plan considers this measure as the one with the greatest impact on the reduction of particle emissions in the domestic sector. From the previous measure it is evident that the eco-design regulations do not cover the entire spectrum of domestic heating devices that could be used with solid biomass. Therefore, despite the efforts planned by Spain to promote the use of types of biomass less polluting and devices that comply with the limits established in the eco-design regulations, there is a lack of harmonized European regulations to cover the two main gaps:
•	Combustion boilers that use solid fuel (including woody biomass) with a nominal thermal power between 500 Kw and 1 MW.
•	Boilers and heaters/stoves that use non-woody biomass as solid fuel (of any nominal thermal power) excluded from both Regulation 2015/1189 and Regulation 2015/1185.
On the other hand, the estimates of the impacts of the consumption of renewable energies carried out by the European Environment Agency9, show how the emissions of particles derived from the use of biomass are not offset by the emissions avoided by the rest of renewables. Only in the year 2021, the increasing effect of the use of heat pumps for heating and cooling, produces a reversal of this fact, becoming renewables as a w",NA,"A qualitative impact estimate has been carried out based on a bibliographic review of data, evaluations, reports, studies and other documents, which have been referenced in the ""Estimated impact"" column and are listed below in order of appearance in the text:
